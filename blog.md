# LeanAI: My First ML Project     

## Inspiration 
    The inspiration for this project starting from a different one of my hobbies. Working out has been central to my personal developement in the past few years; but more importantly dieting to lose or gain weight was a practice that required me to build self-accountability and consistency. A key metric to dictate if one should "bulk" or "cut" is body fat % - in simple terms, how much of your body is composed of fat tissue. Given this percentage, one can make their dieting choices in a scientific, numerical manner, as opposed to purley based on emotions or feeling. Being aware of the importance of body fat %, I made my own post in r/guessmybf, where users estimate your body fat based on uploaded physique photos. A few weeks later, I made the decision to start studying machine learning, and spending a week watching videos, I was ready to translate my knowledge into a project; the first thing that came to mind was a model that would predict one's bodyfat% given a photo.
